tmtk
====

A toolkit for ETL curation for the tranSMART data warehouse. The
TranSMART curation toolkit (``tmtk``) can be used to edit and validate
studies prior to loading them with `transmart-batch`_.

Some features: 
 - create a transmart-batch ready study from clinical data files.
 - load an existing study and validate its contents. 
 - edit the transmart concept tree in The Arborist graphical editor. 
 - create chromosomal region annotation files.

Disclaimer
          

tmtk is a ``python3`` package meant to be run in ``Jupyter notebooks``.
Results for other setups may vary.

For documentation visit `readthedocs`_.

Usage
-----

Step 1: Opening a notebook
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First open a Jupyter Notebook, open a shell and change directory to some
place where your data is. Then start the notebook server:

.. code:: sh

    cd /path/to/studies/
    jupyter notebook

This should open your browser to Jupyters file browser, create a new
notebook for here.

Step 2: Using tmtk
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: py

    # First import the toolkit into your environment
    import tmtk

    # Then create a <tmtk.Study> object by pointing to study.params of a transmart-batch study
    study = tmtk.Study('~/studies/a_tm_batch_ready_study/study.params')
    # Or, by using the study wizard on a directory with correctly structured, clinical data files.
    # (Visit the transmart-batch documentation to find out what is expected.)
    study = tmtk.wizard.create_study('~/studies/dir_with_some_clinical_data_files/')

Now we have loaded the study as a ``tmtk.Study`` object we have some
interesting functions available:

.. code:: py

    # Check whether transmart-batch will find any issues with the way your study is setup
    study.validate_all()

    # Graphically manipulate the concept tree in this study by using The Arborist
    study.call_boris()
