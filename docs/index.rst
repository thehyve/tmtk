.. topic:: Philosophy

   A toolkit for ETL curation for the tranSMART data warehouse for
   translational research.

   The TranSMART curation toolkit (``tmtk``) aims to provide a language
   and set of classes for describing data to be uploaded to tranSMART.
   The toolkit can be used to edit and validate studies prior
   to loading them with `transmart-batch`_.

   Functionality currently available:
    * create a transmart-batch ready study from clinical data files.
    * load an existing study and validate its contents.
    * edit the transmart concept tree in The Arborist graphical editor.
    * create chromosomal region annotation files.
    * map HGNC gene symbols to corresponding Entrez gene IDs using `mygene.info`_.


.. note::

   tmtk is a ``python3`` package meant to be run in ``Jupyter notebooks``. Results
   for other setups may vary.
